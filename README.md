# ACM - SCL

*This is the Standard Code Library (SCL) for Competitive Programming.*

I have implemented many commonly seen/used algorithms and data structures in competitive programming.

You can find the implementations in `code`.

I also wrote a tool to compare the output files, the source code of which can be found in `_cmp`.

Word/PDF documents containing well-organized source code and some useful theorems and formulas can be found in `_SCL`. Most of the theorems and formulas are from *Wikipedia* and *Concrete Mathematics*.

### Notes:
- My C++ compiler is [MinGW-W64](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/) 8.1.0. Compile the code with `c++0y` (a.k.a. C++ 14) compiling option.
- My Java compiler's version is 11.0.1.
- Surely, I am **NOT** the inventor of these amazing algorithms and data structures! I learned them (or the code) from the Internet!

### Tips:
- The code works. I have tested it in several contests. All the algorithms and data structures implemented here have been thoroughly checked. You are sure to get `AC` if they are correctly used.
- Many `vector`s can be replaced with arrays! So as to many other C++ STL classes in the code. If you are getting `TLE` or `MLE`, replace them with arrays or other self-implemented data structures. The SCL should be clear and easy to understand so I used C++ STL classes.
- There are few comments in the code. It would be appreciated if you add any! ^_^
